	* FOR-RELEASE (NEW FEATURES): Completed work on this item:
	Rework how fringe bitmaps are defined and used.
	Currently, bitmap usage and bitmap appearence are "mixed-up" in a
	one-level representation.  It would be cleaner to split the
	representation into a two-level model where first level maps
	bitmap usage to a bitmap name, and second level maps bitmap name to
	a bitmap appearence.
