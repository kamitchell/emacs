Tasks needed before the next release.

* TO BE DONE SHORTLY BEFORE RELEASE

** Check for widow and orphan lines in manuals;
make sure all the pages really look ok in the manual as formatted.

** Check for text in manuals that assumes current version is 21.
eshell.texi 'Known Problems' (does section need updating?)
cc-mode.texi 'Performance Issues': "21.3 as of this writing"

** Cleanup temporary +++/--- lines in etc/NEWS.

** Regenerate the postscript files of the reference cards in etc.
As of 2007/2/26, only ps files older than the associated tex files are:
  cs-dired-ref.ps sk-dired-ref.ps

May need update for Emacs-22:
dired-ref.tex cs-dired-ref.tex fr-drdref.tex sk-dired-ref.tex

Fix overfull lines p3 fr-refcard.ps.


** Ask maintainers of refcard translations to update them.

Reminders sent out on 2006-06-08.

** Send an email to the various distributions, including the GNOME
and KDE projects, to use the new Emacs icons in etc/images/icons.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.
These don't need to be fixed to start pretest, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay  display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

** make-network-process :nowait t doesn't work for non-local targets
   on Windows.  This has been "fixed" for Emacs 22 by defining
   BROKEN_NON_BLOCKING_CONNECT in ms-w32.h.


* BUGS

** Fix up copyright confusions.
  See end of admin/notes/copyright.

** simon.marshall@misys.com, Jan 12:
  Font-lock decides function call is function declaration in C++

** md5i@cs.cmu.edu, Feb 20: move-end-of-line in comint buffers

** daniel@bigwalter.net, Feb 25: Echoing of keys and process I/O

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
