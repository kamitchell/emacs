** Send an email to the various distributions, including the GNOME
and KDE projects, to use the new Emacs icons in etc/images/icons.

* WINDOWS SUPPORT BUGS.
These don't need to be fixed to start pretest, but we call the
attention of Windows users to fixing them.

** Drew Adams 12 Aug bug rpt: overlay  display artifact: trace left behind
Windows only bug. Bug appears only when Cleartype enabled, probably related
to the hack introduced on 2005-07-01 to fix some other Cleartype problem.

** henman@it.to-be.co.jp 09 Aug 2006: ispell.el problem on Cygwin.
  (Did we decide that is unreproducible?)

* BUGS

** make-network-process :nowait t doesn't work for non-local targets
   on Windows.
   If it cannot be fixed, (featurep 'make-network-process '(:nowait t))
   should return nil.

** Document use of gpg-agent

** monnier@iro.umontreal.ca, Nov 24:
  gnus-summary-tick-article-forward doesn't work any more?

** christopher.ian.moore@gmail.com, Nov 30: too much recursion in gnus-sort-threads-1.

** dooglus@gmail.com, Dec 1: Replacement of spaces in wdired

** Should CC mode set beginning-of-defun-function?

* DOCUMENTATION

** Check the Emacs Tutorial.

The first line of every tutorial must begin with text ending in a
period (".", ASCII 0x2E) saying "Emacs Tutorial" in the respective
language.  This should be followed by "See end for copying
conditions", likewise in the respective language.

After each file name, on the same line or the following line, come the
names of the people who have checked it.
