we use a C preprocesor not only in the normal compilation of .c files
into object files, but also for creating

	src/Makefile
	lib-src/Makefile

(delimited by comment "start of cpp stuff").  some cpp implementations
insert whitespace in between tokens.

during makefile creation, the preprocessor symbol NOT_C_CODE is defined.
this should not be defined for normal .c file compilation.

there has been discussion on eliminating this use of cpp and relying
solely on autoconf processing.  rms says to leave it be.
