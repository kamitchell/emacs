NOTES ON THE EMACS BUG TRACKER   -*- outline -*-

The Emacs Bug Tracker can be found at http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/

For a list of all bugs, see           http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/emacs


** When reporting a bug, to send a Cc to another address (e.g.
bug-cc-mode@gnu.org), do not just use a Cc: header.
Instead, use "X-Debbugs-CC:". This ensures the Cc address will get a
mail with the bug report number in.

** To not get acknowledgement mail from the tracker,
add an "X-Debbugs-No-Ack:" header (with any value).

** To close bug #123 (for example), send mail

  To: 123-done@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com

with a brief explanation in the body as to why the bug was closed.


** To reopen a closed bug #123:

  To: control@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com

  reopen 123
  thanks

** quit|stop|thank|thanks|thankyou|thank you
On a line by itself, this tells the control server to ignore the rest of
the message.

** Bugs can be tagged in various ways (eg wontfix, patch, etc).
For a list of available tags, see:
http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/Developer#tags

** To tag bug #123 (for example), send a mail of the form:

  To: control@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com

  tags 123 wontfix
  thanks

Or just add the

  tags 123 wontfix
  thanks

at the beginning of a reply.  The tag can be prefixed with +, - or =,
meaning to add (the default), remove, or reset the tags.

** To remove spam from the tracker, move it to the `spam' pseudo-package:

  To: control@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com

  reassign 123 spam
  thanks

** To merge bugs:
Eg when bad replies create a bunch of new bugs for the same report.
Bugs must all be in the same state.

  To: control@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com
  merge 123 124 125 ...

** To set severity:

  To: control@emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com
  severity 123 critical|grave|serious|important|normal|minor|wishlist

See http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/Developer#severities for the meanings.
