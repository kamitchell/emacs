This file describes the CVS branch in which it is maintained.
Everything below the line is branch-specific.
________________________________________________________________________

This is the "ttn-vms-21-3-stash" branch.  Its primary purpose is to
accumulate changes based on the Emacs 21.3 release that support building
Emacs 21.3 under OpenVMS 7.3-1, aka simply "VMS".  You probably invoked
the command "cvs checkout -r ttn-vms-21-3-stash", otherwise you wouldn't
be reading this.

The plans for this branch are to continue updating it with the results
of an ongoing porting effort, until enough changes are included so that
Emacs 21.3 for VMS can be built "out of the box".  (This file will be
then amended to indicate no further plans for the branch.)

This branch will not be integrated with the trunk (or with any other
branch, for that matter).
