This file describes the CVS branch in which it is maintained.
Everything below the line is branch-specific.
________________________________________________________________________

This is the "HEAD" branch, otherwise known as the "trunk".  Its primary
purpose is to accumulate changes that are not yet partitioned into a
specific (versioned) release.  When people say "use CVS emacs", this is
the branch they are talking about.  Likewise, a "cvs checkout" without
the "-r" option results in this branch.

The plans for this branch are not specified; Emacs hackers add to it
relatively free of constraint (aside from proper legal / accounting
practices), although sometimes there is related discussion on the
emacs-devel mailing list.

The closure process for this branch is undocumented; concepts such as
"freeze", "release", or "integration with the trunk" are not applicable
to this branch.
