	 ;; In all (X)Emacsen so far, `eval-when-compile' byte compiles
	 ;; its contents before evaluating it.  That can cause forms to
	 ;; be compiled in situations they aren't intended to be
	 ;; compiled.
	 ;;
	 ;; Example: It's not possible to defsubst a primitive, e.g. the
	 ;; following will produce an error (in any emacs flavor), since
	 ;; `nthcdr' is a primitive function that's handled specially by
	 ;; the byte compiler and thus can't be redefined:
	 ;;
	 ;;     (defsubst nthcdr (val) val)
	 ;;
	 ;; `defsubst', like `defmacro', needs to be evaluated at
	 ;; compile time, so this will produce an error during byte
	 ;; compilation.
	 ;;
	 ;; CC Mode occasionally needs to do things like this for
	 ;; cross-emacs compatibility.  It therefore uses the following

	 ;;

	 ;; and including Emacs 20.6 and XEmacs 21.1 as of this
	 ;; writing).  So this will still produce an error, since the
	 ;; byte compiler will get to the defsubst anyway.  That's
	 ;; arguably a bug because the point with `eval-when-compile' is
	 ;; that it should evaluate rather than compile its contents.
	 ;;
	 ;; We get around it by expanding the body to a quoted
	 ;; constant that we eval.  That otoh introduce a problem in
	 ;; that a returned lambda expression doesn't get byte

;;; System for handling language dependent constants.

;; This is used to set various language dependent data in a flexible
;; way: Language constants can be built from the values of other
;; language constants, also those for other languages.  They can also
;; process the values of other language constants uniformly across all
;; the languages.  E.g. one language constant can list all the type
;; keywords in each language, and another can build a regexp for each
;; language from those lists without code duplication.
;;
;; Language constants are defined with `c-lang-defconst', and their
;; value forms (referred to as source definitions) are evaluated only
;; on demand when requested for a particular language with
;; `c-lang-const'.  It's therefore possible to refer to the values of
;; constants defined later in the file, or in another file, just as
;; long as all the relevant `c-lang-defconst' have been loaded when
;; `c-lang-const' is actually evaluated from somewhere else.
;;
;; `c-lang-const' forms are also evaluated at compile time and
;; replaced with the values they produce.  Thus there's no overhead
;; for this system when compiled code is used - only the values
;; actually used in the code are present, and the file(s) containing
;; the `c-lang-defconst' forms don't need to be loaded at all then.
;; There are however safeguards to make sure that they can be loaded
;; to get the source definitions for the values if there's a mismatch
;; in compiled versions, or if `c-lang-const' is used uncompiled.
;;
;; Note that the source definitions in a `c-lang-defconst' form are
;; compiled into the .elc file where it stands; there's no need to
;; load the source file to get it.
;;
;; See cc-langs.el for more details about how this system is deployed
;; in CC Mode, and how the associated language variable system
;; (`c-lang-defvar') works.  That file also contains a lot of

  "Set the language specific values of the language constant NAME.
The second argument can be an optional docstring.  The rest of the
arguments are one or more repetitions of LANG VAL where LANG specifies
the language(s) that VAL applies to.  LANG is the name of the
language, i.e. the mode name without the \"-mode\" suffix, or a list
of such language names, or `t' for all languages.  VAL is a form to
evaluate to get the value.

If LANG isn't `t' or one of the core languages in CC Mode, it must
have been declared with `c-add-language'.

Neither NAME, LANG nor VAL are evaluated directly - they should not be
quoted.  `c-lang-defconst-eval-immediately' can however be used inside
VAL to evaluate parts of it directly.

When VAL is evaluated for some language, that language is temporarily
made current so that `c-lang-const' without an explicit language can
be used inside VAL to refer to the value of a language constant in the
same language.  That is particularly useful if LANG is `t'.

VAL is not evaluated right away but rather when the value is requested
with `c-lang-const'.  Thus it's possible to use `c-lang-const' inside
VAL to refer to language constants that haven't been defined yet.
However, if the definition of a language constant is in another file
then that file must be loaded \(at compile time) before it's safe to
reference the constant.

The assignments in ARGS are processed in sequence like `setq', so
\(c-lang-const NAME) may be used inside a VAL to refer to the last
assigned value to this language constant, or a value that it has
gotten in another earlier loaded file.

To work well with repeated loads and interactive reevaluation, only
one `c-lang-defconst' for each NAME is permitted per file.  If there
already is one it will be completely replaced; the value in the

constant.  A file is identified by its base name.
