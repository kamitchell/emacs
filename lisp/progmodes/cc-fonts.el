;;; Commentary:

;; Some comments on the use of faces:
;;
;; o  `c-label-face-name' is either `font-lock-constant-face' (in Emacs
;;    20 and later), or `font-lock-reference-face'.
;;
;; o  `c-constant-face-name', `c-reference-face-name' and
;;    `c-doc-markup-face-name' are essentially set up like
;;    `c-label-face-name'.
;;
;; o  `c-preprocessor-face-name' is `font-lock-preprocessor-face' in
;;    XEmacs and - in lack of a closer equivalent -
;;    `font-lock-builtin-face' or `font-lock-reference-face' in Emacs.
;;
;; o  `c-doc-face-name' is `font-lock-doc-string-face' in XEmacs,
;;    `font-lock-doc-face' in Emacs 21 and later, or
;;    `font-lock-comment-face' in older Emacs (that since source
;;    documentation are actually comments in these languages, as opposed
;;    to elisp).
;;
;; o  `c-invalid-face-name' is `font-lock-warning-face' in Emacs.  In
;;    older XEmacs there's no corresponding standard face, so there
;;    it's mapped to a special `c-invalid-face'.
;;
;; TBD: We should probably provide real faces for the above uses and
;; instead initialize them from the standard faces.

;;; Code:

;; The faces that already have been put onto the text is tested in
;; various places to direct further fontifications.  For this to work,
;; the following assumptions regarding the faces must hold (apart from
;; the dependencies on the font locking order):
;;
;; o  `font-lock-comment-face' and the face in `c-doc-face-name' is
;;    not used in anything but comments.
;; o  If any face (e.g. `c-doc-markup-face-name') but those above is
;;    used in comments, it doesn't replace them.
;; o  `font-lock-string-face' is not used in anything but string
;;    literals (single or double quoted).
;; o  `font-lock-keyword-face' and the face in `c-label-face-name' are
;;    never overlaid with other faces.
