;;; Requirements:

;; doc-view.el requires GNU Emacs 22.1 or newer.  You also need Ghostscript,
;; `dvipdfm' which comes with teTeX and `pdftotext', which comes with xpdf
;; (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/) or poppler (http://poppler.freedesktop.org/).

;;; Commentary:

;; DocView is a document viewer for Emacs.  It converts PDF, PS and DVI files
;; to a set of PNG files, one PNG for each page, and displays the PNG images
;; inside an Emacs buffer.  This buffer uses `doc-view-mode' which provides
;; convenient key bindings for browsing the document.
;;
;; To use it simply open a document file with
;;
;;     C-x C-f ~/path/to/document RET
;;
;; and the document will be converted and displayed, if your emacs supports png
;; images.  With `C-c C-c' you can toggle between the rendered images
;; representation and the source text representation of the document.
;;
;; Since conversion may take some time all the PNG images are cached in a
;; subdirectory of `doc-view-cache-directory' and reused when you want to view
;; that file again.  To reconvert a document hit `g' (`doc-view-reconvert-doc')
;; when displaying the document.  To delete all cached files use
;; `doc-view-clear-cache'.  To open the cache with dired, so that you can tidy
;; it out use `doc-view-dired-cache'.
;;
;; When conversion in underway the first page will be displayed as soon as it
;; is available and the available pages are refreshed every
;; `doc-view-conversion-refresh-interval' seconds.  If that variable is nil the
;; pages won't be displayed before conversion of the document finished
;; completely.
;;
;; DocView lets you select a slice of the displayed pages.  This slice will be
;; remembered and applied to all pages of the current document.  This enables
;; you to cut away the margins of a document to save some space.  To select a
;; slice you can use `doc-view-set-slice' (bound to `s s') which will query you
;; for the coordinates of the slice's top-left corner and its width and height.
;; A much more convenient way to do the same is offered by the command
;; `doc-view-set-slice-using-mouse' (bound to `s m').  After invokation you
;; only have to press mouse-1 at the top-left corner and drag it to the
;; bottom-right corner of the desired slice.  To reset the slice use
;; `doc-view-reset-slice' (bound to `s r').
;;
;; You can also search within the document.  The command `doc-view-search'
;; (bound to `C-s') queries for a search regexp and initializes a list of all
;; matching pages and messages how many match-pages were found.  After that you
;; can jump to the next page containing a match with an additional `C-s'.  With
;; `C-r' you can do the same, but backwards.  To search for a new regexp give a
;; prefix arg to one of the search functions, e.g. by typing `C-u C-s'.  The
;; searching works by using a plain text representation of the document.  If
;; that doesn't already exist the first invokation of `doc-view-search' (or
;; `doc-view-search-backward') starts the conversion.  When that finishes and
;; you're still viewing the document (i.e. you didn't switch to another buffer)
;; you're queried for the regexp then.
;;
;; Dired users can simply hit `v' on a document file.  If it's a PS, PDF or DVI
;; it will be opened using `doc-view-mode'.
;;

;;; Configuration:

;; If the images are too small or too big you should set the "-rXXX" option in
;; `doc-view-ghostscript-options' to another value.  (The bigger your screen,
;; the higher the value.)
;;
;; This and all other options can be set with the customization interface.
;; Simply do
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET doc-view RET
;;
;; and modify them to your needs.

;;; Todo:

;; - add print command.
;; - share more code with image-mode.
;; - better menu.
;; - Bind slicing to a drag event.
;; - doc-view-fit-doc-to-window and doc-view-fit-window-to-doc.
;; - zoom the region around the cursor (like xdvi).
;; - get rid of the silly arrow in the fringe.
;; - improve anti-aliasing (pdf-utils gets it better).

;;;; About isearch support

;; I tried implementing isearch by setting
;; `isearch-search-fun-function' buffer-locally, but that didn't
;; work too good.  The function doing the real search was called
;; endlessly somehow.  But even if we'd get that working no real
;; isearch feeling comes up due to the missing match highlighting.
;; Currently I display all lines containing a match in a tooltip and
;; each C-s or C-r jumps directly to the next/previous page with a
;; match.  With isearch we could only display the current match.  So
;; we had to decide if another C-s jumps to the next page with a
;; match (thus only the first match in a page will be displayed in a
;; tooltip) or to the next match, which would do nothing visible
;; (except the tooltip) if the next match is on the same page.

;; And it's much slower than the current search facility, because
;; isearch really searches for each step forward or backward wheras
;; the current approach searches once and then it knows to which
;; pages to jump.

;; Anyway, if someone with better isearch knowledge wants to give it a try,
;; feel free to do it.  --Tassilo
