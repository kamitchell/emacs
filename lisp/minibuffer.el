;;; Commentary:

;; Names starting with "minibuffer--" are for functions and variables that
;; are meant to be for internal use only.

;;; Todo:

;; - Make read-file-name-predicate obsolete.
;; - New command minibuffer-force-complete that chooses one of all-completions.
;; - Add vc-file-name-completion-table to read-file-name-internal.
;; - A feature like completing-help.el.
;; - Make the `hide-spaces' arg of all-completions obsolete?

;;; Code:

 (If DEFAULT-FILENAME is omitted, the visited file name is used,
  except that if INITIAL is specified, that combined with DIR is used.)
If the user exits with an empty minibuffer, this function returns
an empty string.  (This can only happen if the user erased the
pre-inserted contents or if `insert-default-directory' is nil.)
Fourth arg MUSTMATCH non-nil means require existing file's name.
 Non-nil and non-t means also require confirmation after completion.
Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.
If optional sixth arg PREDICATE is non-nil, possible completions and
the resulting file name must satisfy (funcall PREDICATE NAME).
DIR should be an absolute directory name.  It defaults to the value of
`default-directory'.

If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a file dialog box if
`use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X toolkit in use
provides a file dialog box.
