;;; Commentary:

;; Reveal mode is a minor mode that makes sure that text around point
;; is always visible.  When point enters a region of hidden text,
;; `reveal-mode' temporarily makes it visible.
;;
;; This is normally used in conjunction with `outline-minor-mode',
;; `hs-minor-mode', `hide-ifdef-mode', ...
;;
;; It only works with packages that hide text using overlays.
;; Packages can provide special support for it by placing
;; a function in the `reveal-toggle-invisible' property on the symbol
;; used as the value of the `invisible' overlay property.
;; The function is called right after revealing (or re-hiding) the
;; text with two arguments: the overlay and a boolean that's non-nil
;; if we have just revealed the text.  When revealing, that function
;; may re-hide some of the text.

;;; Todo:

;; - find other hysteresis features.

;;; Code:

(require 'pcvs-util)

(defgroup reveal nil
  "Reveal hidden text on the fly."
  :group 'editing)

(defcustom reveal-around-mark t
  "Reveal text around the mark, if active."
