;;; Commentary:

;; Many editors (e.g. Vim) have the feature of saving minibuffer
;; history to an external file after exit.  This package provides the
;; same feature in Emacs.  When Emacs is about the exit,
;; `savehist-save' will dump the contents of various minibuffer
;; histories (as determined by `savehist-history-variables') to a save
;; file (`~/.emacs-history' by default).  Although the package was
;; designed for saving the minibuffer histories, any variables can be
;; saved that way.

;; To use savehist, put the following to `~/.emacs':
;;
;; (require 'savehist)
;; (savehist-load)

;; Be sure to have `savehist.el' in a directory that is in your
;; load-path, and byte-compile it.

Every symbol should refer to a variable.  The variable will be saved
only if it is bound and has a non-nil value.  Thus it is safe to
specify a superset of the variables a user is expected to want to
save.

Default value contains minibuffer history variables used by Emacs, XEmacs,
and Viper (uh-oh).  Note that, if you customize this variable, you
can lose the benefit of future versions of Emacs adding new values to
the list.  Because of that it might be more useful to add values using
