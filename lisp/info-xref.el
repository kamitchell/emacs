;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements some simple checking of external cross references in
;; info files, by attempting to visit the nodes specified.
;;
;; "makeinfo" checks references internal to a document, but not external
;; references, which makes it rather easy for mistakes to creep in or node
;; name changes to go unnoticed.  `Info-validate' doesn't check external
;; references either.
;;
;; `M-x info-xref-check' checks one file.  When invoked from an Info-mode or
;; texinfo-mode buffer, the current info file is the default at the prompt.
;;
;; `M-x info-xref-check-all' looks at everything in the normal info path.
;; This might be a lot of files but it's a good way to check the consistency
;; of the whole system.
;;
;; Results are shown in a buffer.  The format is a bit rough, but hopefully
;; there won't be too many problems normally, and correcting them is a
;; manual process anyway, a case of finding the right spot in the original
;; .texi and finding what node it ought to point to.
;;
;; When a target info file doesn't exist there's clearly no way to validate
;; node references within it.  A message is given for missing target files
;; (once per source document), it could be simply that the target hasn't
;; been installed, or it could be a mistake in the reference.
;;
;; Indirect info files are understood, just pass the top-level foo.info to
;; `info-xref-check' and it traverses all sub-files.  Compressed info files
;; are accepted too, as usual for `Info-mode'.
;;
;; `info-xref-check-all' is rather permissive in what it considers an info
;; file.  It has to be since info files don't necessarily have a ".info"
;; suffix (eg. this is usual for the emacs manuals).  One consequence of
;; this is that if for instance there's a source code directory in
;; `Info-directory-list' then a lot of extraneous files might be read, which
;; will be time consuming but should be harmless.


;;; Install:

;; Put info-xref.el somewhere in your `load-path', and in your .emacs put
;;
;;     (autoload 'info-xref-check     "info-xref" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'info-xref-check-all "info-xref" nil t)
;;
;; then
;;
;;     M-x info-xref-check
;;
;; and enter an info file name.
