;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a lightweight alternative to emerge/ediff.
;; To use it, simply add to your .emacs the following lines:
;;
;;   (autoload 'smerge-mode "smerge-mode" nil t)
;;
;; you can even have it turned on automatically with the following
;; piece of code in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (defun sm-try-smerge ()
;;     (save-excursion
;;   	 (goto-char (point-min))
;;   	 (when (re-search-forward "^<<<<<<< " nil t)
;;   	   (smerge-mode 1))))
;;   (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'sm-try-smerge t)

;;; Todo:

;; - if requested, ask the user whether he wants to call ediff right away

;;; Code:
