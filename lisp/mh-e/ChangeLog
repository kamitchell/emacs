	* mh-e.el, mh-funcs.el, mh-init.el, mh-mime.el, mh-pick.el:

	need to be indented. 
	
	* mh-seq.el (mh-non-seq-mode-line-annotation): Moved
	make-variable-buffer-local call to top level to avoid warnings in
	CVS Emacs.

	with read-string.

	* mh-init.el (mh-image-load-path): New function that adds the path
	to the MH-E images to the image-load-path or load-path depending
	on the version of Emacs.

	* mh-customize.el: Call mh-image-load-path just before
	mh-tool-bar-define so that the toolbar images can be found.
