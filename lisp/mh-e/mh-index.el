;;; Commentary:

;;;  (1) The following search engines are supported:
;;;        swish++
;;;        swish-e
;;;        mairix
;;;        namazu
;;;        grep
;;;
;;;  (2) To use this package, you first have to build an index. Please read
;;;      the documentation for `mh-index-search' to get started. That
;;;      documentation will direct you to the specific instructions for your
;;;      particular indexer.

;;; Change Log:

  "Perform an indexed search in an MH mail folder.
Use a prefix argument to repeat the search, as in REDO-SEARCH-FLAG below.

If REDO-SEARCH-FLAG is non-nil and the current folder buffer was generated by a
index search, then the search is repeated. Otherwise, FOLDER is searched with
SEARCH-REGEXP and the results are presented in an MH-E folder. If FOLDER is
\"+\" then mail in all folders are searched. Optional argument WINDOW-CONFIG
stores the window configuration that will be restored after the user quits the
folder containing the index search results.

Four indexing programs are supported; if none of these are present, then grep
is used. This function picks the first program that is available on your
system. If you would prefer to use a different program, set the customization
variable `mh-index-program' accordingly.

The documentation for the following functions describes how to generate the
index for each program:

    - `mh-swish++-execute-search'
    - `mh-swish-execute-search'
    - `mh-mairix-execute-search'
    - `mh-namazu-execute-search'

If none of these programs are present then we use pick. If desired grep can be
used instead. Details about these methods can be found in:

    - `mh-pick-execute-search'
    - `mh-grep-execute-search'

This and related functions use an X-MHE-Checksum header to cache the MD5
checksum of a message. This means that already present X-MHE-Checksum headers
in the incoming email could result in messages not being found. The following
procmail recipe should avoid this:

  :0 wf
  | formail -R \"X-MHE-Checksum\" \"Old-X-MHE-Checksum\"

This has the effect of renaming already present X-MHE-Checksum headers."
