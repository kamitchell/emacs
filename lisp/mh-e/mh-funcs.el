;;; Commentary:

;; Internal support for MH-E package.
;; Putting these functions in a separate file lets MH-E start up faster,
;; since less Lisp code needs to be loaded all at once.

;;; Change Log:

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'mh-acros))
(mh-require-cl)
(require 'mh-e)

;;; Customization
