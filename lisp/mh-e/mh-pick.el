  "Search FOLDER for messages matching a pattern.

With this command, you can search a folder for messages to or
from a particular person or about a particular subject. In fact,
you can also search for messages containing selected strings in
any arbitrary header field or any string found within the
messages.

You are first prompted for the name of the folder to search and
then placed in the following buffer in MH-Pick mode:

     From:
     To:
     Cc:
     Date:
     Subject:
     --------

Edit this template by entering your search criteria in an
appropriate header field that is already there, or create a new
field yourself. If the string you're looking for could be
anywhere in a message, then place the string underneath the row
of dashes. The command \\[mh-search-folder] uses the MH command
\"pick\" to do the real work.

There are no semantics associated with the search criteria--they
are simply treated as strings. Case is ignored when all lowercase
is used, and regular expressions (a la \"ed\") are available. It
is all right to specify several search criteria. What happens
then is that a logical _and_ of the various fields is performed.
If you prefer a logical _or_ operation, run \\[mh-search-folder]
multiple times.

As an example, let's say that we want to find messages from
Ginnean about horseback riding in the Kosciusko National
Park (Australia) during January, 1994. Normally we would start
with a broad search and narrow it down if necessary to produce a
manageable amount of data, but we'll cut to the chase and create
a fairly restrictive set of criteria as follows:

     From: ginnean
     To:
     Cc:
     Date: Jan 1994
     Subject: horse.*kosciusko
     --------

As with MH-Letter mode, MH-Pick provides commands like
\\<mh-pick-mode-map>\\[mh-to-field] to help you fill in the
blanks.

To perform the search, type \\[mh-do-search]. The selected
messages are placed in the \"search\" sequence, which you can use
later in forwarding, printing, or narrowing your field of view.
Subsequent searches are appended to the \"search\" sequence. If,
however, you wish to start with a clean slate, first delete the
\"search\" sequence.

If you're searching in a folder that is already displayed in an
MH-Folder buffer, only those messages contained in the buffer are
used for the search. Therefore, if you want to search in all
messages, first kill the folder's buffer with
\\<mh-folder-mode-map>\\[kill-buffer] or scan the entire folder
with \\[mh-rescan-folder].

If you find that you do the same thing over and over when editing
the search template, you may wish to bind some shortcuts to keys.
This can be done with the variable `mh-pick-mode-hook', which is
called when \\[mh-search-folder] is run on a new pattern.

If you have run the \\[mh-index-search] command, but change your
mind while entering the search criteria and actually want to run
a regular search, then you can use the command
\\<mh-pick-mode-map>\\[mh-pick-do-search] in the MH-Pick buffer.

In a program, argument WINDOW-CONFIG is the current window
configuration and is used when the search folder is dismissed."
