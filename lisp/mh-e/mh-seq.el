;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   This tries to implement the algorithm described at:
;;     http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html
;;   It is also a start to implementing the IMAP Threading extension RFC. The
;;   implementation lacks the reference and subject canonicalization of the
;;   RFC.
;;
;;   In the presentation buffer, children messages are shown indented with
;;   either [ ] or < > around them. Square brackets ([ ]) denote that the
;;   algorithm can point out some headers which when taken together implies
;;   that the unindented message is an ancestor of the indented message. If
;;   no such proof exists then angles (< >) are used.
;;
;;   Some issues and problems are as follows:
;;
;;    (1) Scan truncates the fields at length 512. So longer references:
;;        headers get mutilated. The same kind of MH format string works when
;;        composing messages. Is there a way to avoid this? My scan command
;;        is as follows:
;;          scan +folder -width 10000 \
;;               -format "%(msg)\n%{message-id}\n%{references}\n%{subject}\n"
;;        I would really appreciate it if someone would help me with this.
;;
;;    (2) Implement heuristics to recognize message identifiers in
;;        In-Reply-To: header. Right now it just assumes that the last text
;;        between angles (< and >) is the message identifier. There is the
;;        chance that this will incorrectly use an email address like a
;;        message identifier.
;;
;;    (3) Error checking of found message identifiers should be done.
;;
;;    (4) Since this breaks the assumption that message indices increase as
;;        one goes down the buffer, the binary search based mh-goto-msg
;;        doesn't work. I have a simpler replacement which may be less
;;        efficient.
;;
;;    (5) Better canonicalizing for message identifier and subject strings.
;;

are returned. Finally as a last resort prompt the user.

If EXPAND-FLAG is non-nil then a list of message numbers corresponding
to the input is returned. If this list is empty then an error is
raised. If EXPAND-FLAG is nil just return the input string. In this
case we don't check if the range is empty.

If ASK-FLAG is non-nil, then the user is always queried for a range of
messages. If ASK-FLAG is nil, then the function checks if the unseen
sequence is non-empty. If that is the case, `mh-unseen-seq', or the
list of messages in it depending on the value of EXPAND, is returned.
Otherwise if the folder has fewer than `mh-large-folder' messages then
the list of messages corresponding to \"all\" is returned. If neither
of the above holds then as a last resort the user is queried for a
range of messages.

If NUMBER-AS-RANGE-FLAG is non-nil, then if a number, N is read as
input, it is interpreted as the range \"last:N\".

This function replaces the existing function `mh-read-msg-range'.
Calls to:

  (mh-read-msg-range folder flag)

should be replaced with:
