;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Defines the mode `file-name-shadow-mode'.
;;
;; The `read-file-name' function passes its result through
;; `substitute-in-file-name', so any part of the string preceding
;; multiple slashes (or a drive indicator on MS-DOS/MS-Windows) is
;; ignored.
;;
;; If `file-name-shadow-mode' is active, any part of the
;; minibuffer text that would be ignored because of this is given the
;; properties in `file-name-shadow-properties', which may
;; be used to make the ignored text invisible, dim, etc.
