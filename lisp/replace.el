In TO-STRING, `\\&' stands for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP,
and `\\=\\N' (where N is a digit) stands for
whatever what matched the Nth `\\(...\\)' in REGEXP.
`\\?' lets you edit the replacement text in the minibuffer
at the given position for each replacement.

In interactive calls, the replacement text can contain `\\,'
followed by a Lisp expression.  Each
replacement evaluates that expression to compute the replacement
string.  Inside of that expression, `\\&' is a string denoting the
whole match as a string, `\\N' for a partial match, `\\#&' and `\\#N'
for the whole or a partial match converted to a number with
`string-to-number', and `\\#' itself for the number of replacements
done so far (starting with zero).

If the replacement expression is a symbol, write a space after it
to terminate it.  One space there, if any, will be discarded.

When using those Lisp features interactively in the replacement
text, TO-STRING is actually made a list instead of a string.
Use \\[repeat-complex-command] after this command for details."

  "Replace some things after point matching REGEXP with the result of TO-EXPR.
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying

TO-EXPR is a Lisp expression evaluated to compute each replacement.  It may
reference `replace-count' to get the number of replacements already made.
If the result of TO-EXPR is not a string, it is converted to one using
`prin1-to-string' with the NOESCAPE argument (which see).

For convenience, when entering TO-EXPR interactively, you can use `\\&' or
`\\0' to stand for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP, and `\\N' (where
N is a digit) to stand for whatever matched the Nth `\\(...\\)' in REGEXP.
Use `\\#&' or `\\#N' if you want a number instead of a string.
In interactive use, `\\#' in itself stands for `replace-count'.

If your Lisp expression is an identifier and the next letter in
