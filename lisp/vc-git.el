;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains a VC backend for the git version control
;; system.
;;

;;; Installation:

;; To install: put this file on the load-path and add GIT to the list
;; of supported backends in `vc-handled-backends'; the following line,
;; placed in your ~/.emacs, will accomplish this:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'GIT)

;;; Todo:
;;  - check if more functions could use vc-git-command instead
;;     of start-process.
;;  - changelog generation
;;  - working with revisions other than HEAD

;; Implement the rest of the vc interface. See the comment at the
;; beginning of vc.el. The current status is:
