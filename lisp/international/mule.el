;;; CHARSET

(defun define-charset (name docstring &rest props)
  "Define NAME (symbol) as a charset with DOCSTRING.
The remaining arguments must come in pairs ATTRIBUTE VALUE.  ATTRIBUTE
may be any symbol.  The following have special meanings, and one of
`:code-offset', `:map', `:subset', `:superset' must be specified.

`:short-name'

VALUE must be a short string to identify the charset.  If omitted,
NAME is used.

`:long-name'

VALUE must be a string longer than `:short-name' to identify the
charset.  If omitted, the value of the `:short-name' attribute is used.

`:dimension'

VALUE must be an integer 0, 1, 2, or 3, specifying the dimension of
code-points of the charsets.  If omitted, it is calculated from the
value of the `:code-space' attribute.

`:code-space'

VALUE must be a vector of length at most 8 specifying the byte code
range of each dimension in this format:
	[ MIN-1 MAX-1 MIN-2 MAX-2 ... ]
where MIN-N is the minimum byte value of Nth dimension of code-point,
MAX-N is the maximum byte value of that.

`:min-code'

VALUE must be an integer specifying the mininum code point of the
charset.  If omitted, it is calculated from `:code-space'.  VALUE may
be a cons (HIGH . LOW), where HIGH is the most significant 16 bits of
the code point and LOW is the least significant 16 bits.

`max-code'

VALUE must be an integer specifying the maxinum code point of the
charset.  If omitted, it is calculated from `:code-space'.  VALUE may
be a cons (HIGH . LOW), where HIGH is the most significant 16 bits of
the code point and LOW is the least significant 16 bits.

`:iso-final-char'

VALUE must be a character in the range 32 to 127 (inclusive)
specifying the final char of the charset for ISO-2022 encoding.  If
omitted, the charset can't be encoded by ISO-2022 based
coding-systems.

`:iso-revision-number'

VALUE must be an integer in the range 0..63, specifying the revision
number of the charset for ISO-2022 encoding.

`:emacs-mule-id'

VALUE must be an integer of 0, 128..255.  If omitted, the charset
can't be encoded by coding-systems of type `emacs-mule'.

`:ascii-compatible-p'

VALUE must be nil or t (default nil).  If VALUE is t, the charset is
compatible with ASCII, i.e. the first 128 code points map to ASCII.

`:supplementary-p'

VALUE must be nil or t.  If the VALUE is t, the charset is
supplementary, which means it is used only as a parent of some other
charset.

`:invalid-code'

VALUE must be a nonnegative integer that can be used as an invalid
code point of the charset.  If the minimum code is 0 and the maximum
code is greater than Emacs' maximum integer value, `:invalid-code'
should not be omitted.

`:code-offset'

VALUE must be an integer added to the index number of a character to
get the corresponding character code.

`:map'

VALUE must be vector or string.

If it is a vector, the format is [ CODE-1 CHAR-1 CODE-2 CHAR-2 ... ],
where CODE-n is a code-point of the charset, and CHAR-n is the
corresponding character code.

If it is a string, it is a name of file that contains the above
information.   Each line of the file must be this format:
	0xXXX 0xYYY
where XXX is a hexadecimal representation of CODE-n and YYY is a
hexadecimal representation of CHAR-n.  A line starting with `#' is a
comment line.

`:subset'

VALUE must be a list:
	( PARENT MIN-CODE MAX-CODE OFFSET )
PARENT is a parent charset.  MIN-CODE and MAX-CODE specify the range
of characters inherited from the parent.  OFFSET is an integer value
to add to a code point of the parent charset to get the corresponding
code point of this charset.

`:superset'

VALUE must be a list of parent charsets.  The charset inherits
characters from them.  Each element of the list may be a cons (PARENT
. OFFSET), where PARENT is a parent charset, and OFFSET is an offset
value to add to a code point of PARENT to get the corresponding code
point of this charset.

`:unify-map'

VALUE must be vector or string.

If it is a vector, the format is [ CODE-1 CHAR-1 CODE-2 CHAR-2 ... ],
where CODE-n is a code-point of the charset, and CHAR-n is the
corresponding Unicode character code.

If it is a string, it is a name of file that contains the above
information.  The file format is the same as what described for `:map'
attribute."

  "List of symbols that control ISO-2022 encoder/decoder.

The value of the `:flags' attribute in the argument of the function
`define-coding-system' must be one of them.

If `long-form' is specified, use a long designation sequence on
encoding for the charsets `japanese-jisx0208-1978', `chinese-gb2312',
and `japanese-jisx0208'.  The long designation sequence doesn't
conform to ISO 2022, but is used by such coding systems as
`compound-text'.

If `ascii-at-eol' is specified, designate ASCII to g0 at end of line
on encoding.

If `ascii-at-cntl' is specified, designate ASCII to g0 before control
codes and SPC on encoding.

If `7-bit' is specified, use 7-bit code only on encoding.

If `locking-shift' is specified, decode locking-shift code correctly
on decoding, and use locking-shift to invoke a graphic element on
encoding.

If `single-shift' is specified, decode single-shift code correctly on
decoding, and use single-shift to invoke a graphic element on encoding.

If `designation' is specified, decode designation code correctly on
decoding, and use designation to designate a charset to a graphic
element on encoding.

If `revision' is specified, produce an escape sequence to specify
revision number of a charset on encoding.  Such an escape sequence is
always correctly decoded on decoding.

If `direction' is specified, decode ISO6429's code for specifying
direction correctly, and produce the code on encoding.

If `init-at-bol' is specified, on encoding, it is assumed that
invocation and designation statuses are reset at each beginning of
line even if `ascii-at-eol' is not specified; thus no codes for
resetting them are produced.

If `safe' is specified, on encoding, characters not supported by a
coding are replaced with `?'.

If `latin-extra' is specified, the code-detection routine assumes that a
code specified in `latin-extra-code-table' (which see) is valid.

If `composition' is specified, an escape sequence to specify
composition sequence is correctly decoded on decoding, and is produced
on encoding.

If `euc-tw-shift' is specified, the EUC-TW specific shifting code is
correctly decoded on decoding, and is produced on encoding.

If `use-roman' is specified, JIS0201-1976-Roman is designated instead
of ASCII.

If `use-oldjis' is specified, JIS0208-1976 is designated instead of
JIS0208-1983.")

(defun define-coding-system (name docstring &rest props)
  "Define NAME (a symbol) as a coding system with DOCSTRING and attributes.
The remaining arguments must come in pairs ATTRIBUTE VALUE.  ATTRIBUTE
may be any symbol.

The following attributes have special meanings.  Those labeled as
\"(required)\", should not be omitted.

`:mnemonic' (required)

VALUE is a character to display on mode line for the coding system.

`:coding-type' (required)

VALUE must be one of `charset', `utf-8', `utf-16', `iso-2022',
`emacs-mule', `shift-jis', `big5', `ccl', `raw-text', `undecided'.

`:eol-type'

VALUE is the EOL (end-of-line) format of the coding system.  It must be
one of `unix', `dos', `mac'.  The symbol `unix' means Unix-like EOL
\(i.e. single LF), `dos' means DOS-like EOL \(i.e. sequence of CR LF),
and `mac' means MAC-like EOL \(i.e. single CR).  If omitted, on
decoding by the coding system, Emacs automatically detects the EOL
format of the source text.

`:charset-list' (required for `charset' coding systems)

VALUE must be a list of charsets supported by the coding system.  On
encoding by the coding system, if a character belongs to multiple
charsets in the list, a charset that comes earlier in the list is
selected.

`:ascii-compatible-p'

If VALUE is non-nil, the coding system decodes all 7-bit bytes into
the corresponding ASCII characters, and encodes all ASCII characters
back to the corresponding 7-bit bytes.  VALUE defaults to nil.

`:decode-translation-table'

VALUE must be a translation table to use on decoding.

`:encode-translation-table'

VALUE must be a translation table to use on encoding.

`:post-read-conversion'

VALUE must be a function to call after some text is inserted and
decoded by the coding system itself and before any functions in
`after-insert-functions' are called.  The arguments to this function
are the same as those of a function in `after-insert-file-functions',
i.e. LENGTH of the text to be decoded with point at the head of it,
and the function should leave point unchanged.

`:pre-write-conversion'

VALUE must be a function to call after all functions in
`write-region-annotate-functions' and `buffer-file-format' are called,
and before the text is encoded by the coding system itself.  The
arguments to this function are the same as those of a function in
`write-region-annotate-functions'.

`:default-char'

VALUE must be a character.  On encoding, a character not supported by
the coding system is replaced with VALUE.

`:eol-type'

VALUE must be `unix', `dos', `mac'.  The symbol `unix' means Unix-like
EOL (LF), `dos' means DOS-like EOL (CRLF), and `mac' means MAC-like
EOL (CR).  If omitted, on decoding, the coding system detects EOL
format automatically, and on encoding, uses Unix-like EOL.

`:mime-charset'

VALUE must be a symbol whose name is that of a MIME charset converted
to lower case.

`:flags'

VALUE must be a list of symbols that control the ISO-2022 converter.
Each must be a member of the list `coding-system-iso-2022-flags'
\(which see).  This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type'
is `iso-2022'.

`:designation'

VALUE must be a vector [G0-USAGE G1-USAGE G2-USAGE G3-USAGE].
GN-USAGE specifies the usage of graphic register GN as follows.

If it is nil, no charset can be designated to GN.

If it is a charset, the charset is initially designated to GN, and
never used by the other charsets.

If it is a list, the elements must be charsets, nil, 94, or 96.  GN
can be used by all the listed charsets.  If the list contains 94, any
iso-2022 charset whose code-space ranges are 94 long can be designated
to GN.  If the list contains 96, any charsets whose whose ranges are
96 long can be designated to GN.  If the first element is a charset,
that charset is initially designated to GN.

This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is `iso-2022'.

`:bom'

This attributes specifies whether the coding system uses a `byte order
mark'.  VALUE must nil, t, or cons of coding systems whose
`:coding-type' is `utf-16'.

This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is `utf-16'.

`:endian'

VALUE must be t or nil.  See the above description for the detail.

This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is `utf-16'.

`:ccl-decoder'

VALUE is a symbol representing the registered CCL program used for
decoding.  This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is
`ccl'.

`:ccl-encoder'

VALUE is a symbol representing the registered CCL program used for
encoding.  This attribute has a meaning only when `:coding-type' is
`ccl'."
