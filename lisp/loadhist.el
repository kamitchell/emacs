;; These functions exploit the load-history system variable.
;; Entry points include `unload-feature', `symbol-file', and
;; `feature-file', documented in the Emacs Lisp manual.

undo all the relevant global state changes that may have been made by
loading the package or executing functions in it.  It has access to
the package's feature list (before anything is unbound) in the
