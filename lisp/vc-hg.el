;; Implement Stefan Monnier's advice:
;; vc-hg-registered and vc-hg-state
;; Both of those functions should be super extra careful to fail gracefully in
;; unexpected circumstances. The reason this is important is that any error
;; there will prevent the user from even looking at the file :-(
;; Ideally, just like in vc-arch and vc-cvs, checking that the file is under
;; mercurial's control and extracting the current revision should be done
;; without even using `hg' (this way even if you don't have `hg' installed,
;; Emacs is able to tell you this file is under mercurial's control).
