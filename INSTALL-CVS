	      Building and Installing Emacs from CVS

Some of the files that are included in the Emacs tarball, such as
byte-compiled Lisp files, are not stored in the CVS repository.
Therefore, to build from CVS you must run "make bootstrap"
instead of just "make":

  $ ./configure
  $ make bootstrap

The bootstrap process makes sure all necessary files are rebuilt
before it builds the final Emacs binary.

Normally, it is not necessary to use "make bootstrap" after every CVS
update.  Unless there are problems, we suggest the following
procedure:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ cd lisp
  $ make recompile EMACS=../src/emacs
  $ cd ..
  $ make

(If you want to install the Emacs binary, type "make install" instead
of "make" in the last command.)

If the above procedure fails, try "make bootstrap".

Users of non-Posix systems (MS-Windows etc.) should run the
platform-specific configuration scripts (nt/configure.bat, config.bat,
etc.) before "make bootstrap" or "make"; the rest of the procedure is
applicable to those systems as well.

Note that "make bootstrap" overwrites some files that are under CVS
control, such as lisp/loaddefs.el.  This could produce CVS conflicts
next time that you resync with the CVS.  If you see such conflicts,
overwrite your local copy of the file with the clean version from the
CVS repository.  For example:

    cvs update -C lisp/loaddefs.el

Questions, requests, and bug reports about the CVS versions of Emacs
sould be sent to emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org rather.
