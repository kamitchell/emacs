This subdirectory contains the lwlib library which provides a uniform
interface to a few different X toolkits.  The library was written by
Lucid, and is not part of GNU Emacs.  This version has changes in the
makefile to fit in with Emacs's configure script, and some source
files have been renamed to fit in 14 characters.
