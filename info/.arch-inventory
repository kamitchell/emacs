# Only two real source files: "dir", and this file, ".arch-inventory"
source ^(dir|\.arch-inventory)$

# Everything else is generated at compile time.  Unfortunately, the "backup"

# regexp that matches everything _except_ "dir"...

# 1 or 2 characters long
backup ^[-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]?$
# 4 or more characters long
backup ^[-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+$
# 3 chars long, but 1st char not "d"
backup ^[-_.abce-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]$
# 3 chars long, but 2nd char not "i"
backup ^[-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-hj-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]$
# 3 chars long, but 3rd char not "r"
