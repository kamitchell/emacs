# There are only three real source files in this directory:
#
#   "dir", ".cvsignore", and this file, ".arch-inventory"

# Everything else is generated at compile time.  Unfortunately, the "backup"
# category overrides the "source" category, so we have to have horrible
# regexp that matches everything _except_ "dir"...

# 1 or 2 characters long
backup ^[a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]?$
# 4 or more characters long
backup ^[a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+$
# 3 chars long, but 1st char not "d"
backup ^[abce-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]$
# 3 chars long, but 2nd char not "i"
backup ^[a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-hj-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9]$
# 3 chars long, but 3rd char not "r"
backup ^[a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-zA-Z0-9][-_.a-qs-zA-Z0-9]$
