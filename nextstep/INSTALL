Compilation
-----------

In the top-level directory, use:

  ./configure --with-ns

This will compile all the files, but emacs will not be able to be run except
in -nw (terminal) mode.

In order to run Emacs.app, you must run:

  make install

This will assemble the app in nextstep/Emacs.app.

If you pass the --disable-ns-self-contained option to configure, the lisp
files will be installed under whatever 'prefix' is set to (defaults to
/usr/local).  The bundle will be smaller, but depend on these resources (may
require 'sudo' for "make install").

On OS X you can also open Cocoa/Emacs.xcodeproj and build it again there.  You
may need to set some directories.  (Note, ZeroLink currently does not work
with Emacs owing to the use of private_extern in the code as well as some
other, unidentifiable problem.)  Before doing this you must run "make install"
once as outlined above, to set up the lisp resources.

On GNUstep, you CAN'T use ProjectCenter, since PC cannot work with files
outside of its project directory.


Installation
------------

Move nextstep/Emacs.app to any desired install location.


Distributions and Universal Binaries
------------------------------------

Building as outlined above will create ordinary binaries running on your
architecture only.  To create universal binaries, set CFLAGS to include
"-arch ppc -arch i386".
