* POST_MERGE CLEANUP

** Finish --daemon patch


* CURSOR BUGS:

** (mouse-avoidance-mode 'banish) then minimize Emacs, will pop window back up
   on top of all others

** cursor-over bugs w/some scripts (move around in HELLO to see)


* OTHER BUGS

** Remove Feval calls relating to insert working text in isearch mode.

** free_frame_resources, face colors

** numeric keysetting bug

** http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=ns


* MAC-RELATED:

** open file:/// URLs

** finish handle terminate request (user logout)

** put frame autopositioning into C code somewhere -- if loc = same, offset

** automap ctrl-mouse-1 to mouse-3

** deal with Finder aliases somehow

** Ctrl-F2 won't pull up menus


* OTHER / LOW PRIORITY:

** better recog of unicode scripts / Greek / composition

** Ctrl-g not picked up in all situations;
   get --experimental-ctrl-g in 'compile' working better

** Exec-dump not working on GNUstep (so slow startup).

** undo for color-drag face customization
