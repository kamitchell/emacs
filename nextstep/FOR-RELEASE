* BUGS
* NON-SPECIFIC

** Find out why char_quoted() in syntax.c gets called with charpos < 2 ||
   bytepos < 2 only under NS port.

** Remove Feval calls relating to insert working text in isearch mode.

** free_frame_resources, face colors

** look at nsfont_char_width and nsfont_string_width utils (Dan C.)

** config improvements (Dan C.)

** numeric keysetting bug


* Mac-related:

** open file:/// URLs

** finish handle terminate request (user logout)

** put frame autopositioning into C code somewhere -- if loc = same, offset

** automap ctrl-mouse-1 to mouse-3

** deal with Finder aliases somehow

** Ctrl-F2 won't pull up menus


* Cursor:

** ns_cursor_blink_rate: change to use generic code; also, when set in
   preferences, somehow save the option (but calling custom-save-all
   from this causes error)

** cursor nonerase on certain Leopard and Tiger installations

** if I do:  (mouse-avoidance-mode 'banish) and then minimize Emacs, it pops back immediately.
  Also, it insists on being on top of other windows if they overlap.

** cursor-over bugs w/some scripts (move around in HELLO to see)


* Other:

** better recog of unicode scripts / Greek / composition

** Ctrl-g not picked up in all situations get --experimental-ctrl-g in 'compile' working better

** Exec-dump not working on GNUstep (so slow startup).

** undo for color-drag face customization
