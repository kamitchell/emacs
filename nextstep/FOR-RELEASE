* POST_MERGE CLEANUP

** remove aliases from x- to ns- in ns-win.el and replace by function renames

** remove all the /* 23 */ comments from the source code

** replace all references to PENDING: with something else


* CURSOR BUGS:

** ns_cursor_blink_rate: change to use generic code; also, when set in
   preferences, somehow save the option (but calling custom-save-all
   from this causes error)

** cursor nonerase on certain Leopard and Tiger installations

** (mouse-avoidance-mode 'banish) then minimize Emacs, will pop window back up
   on top of all others

** cursor-over bugs w/some scripts (move around in HELLO to see)


* OTHER BUGS

** Find out why char_quoted() in syntax.c gets called with charpos < 2 ||
   bytepos < 2 only under NS port.

** Remove Feval calls relating to insert working text in isearch mode.

** free_frame_resources, face colors

** numeric keysetting bug

** http://emacsbugs.donarmstrong.com/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=openstep


* MAC-RELATED:

** open file:/// URLs

** finish handle terminate request (user logout)

** put frame autopositioning into C code somewhere -- if loc = same, offset

** automap ctrl-mouse-1 to mouse-3

** deal with Finder aliases somehow

** Ctrl-F2 won't pull up menus

** set were-is-preferred-modifier to Qsuper when ns-extended-platform-support
   mode on (and recompute menubar bindings if needed)


* OTHER / LOW PRIORITY:

** better recog of unicode scripts / Greek / composition

** Ctrl-g not picked up in all situations get --experimental-ctrl-g in 'compile' working better

** Exec-dump not working on GNUstep (so slow startup).

** undo for color-drag face customization

** look at nsfont_char_width and nsfont_string_width utils (Dan C.)
