;;; Commentary:

;; Under VMS the standard make-like program is called MMS, which looks
;; for an input file in the default directory named DESCRIP.MMS and runs
;; the DCL command rules therein.  As of 2005, the build process
;; requires a hand translation of the Makefile.in and Emacs-specific
;; methodology to DCL and TPU commands, so to alleviate this pain, we
;; provide `make-mms-derivative', which given a source FILENAME, inserts
;; the file contents in a new buffer and loads FILENAME-2mms.  The lisp
;; code in the -2mms file can (do whatever -- it's emacs -- and), as
;; long as it arranges to write out the modified buffer after loading by
;; specifying, on a line of its own, the directive:
;;
;;  :output RELATIVE-OUTPUT
;;
;; where RELATIVE-OUTPUT is a filename (a string) relative to FILENAME's
;; directory, typically something simple like "descrip.mms_in_in".  Only
;; the first :output directive is recognized.
;;
;; The only other special directive at this time has the form:
;;
;;  :gigo NAME
;;  ;;blah blah blah
;;  ;;(more text here)
;;
;; NAME is anything distinguishable w/ `eq' (number, symbol or keyword).
;; This associates NAME with the block of text starting immediately below
;; the :gigo directive and ending at the first line that does not begin
;; with two semicolons (which are stripped from each line in the block).
;; To insert this block of text, pass NAME to `make-mms-derivative-gigo'.
;;
;; Directives are scanned before normal evaluation, so their placement
;; in the file is not important.  During loading, plain strings are
;; displayed in the echo area, prefixed with the current line number.
;;
;; Over the long run, the convenience functions provided (see source)
;; will be augmented by factoring maximally the -2mms files, squeezing
;; as much algorithm out of those nasty heuristics as possible.  What
;; makes them nasty is not that they rely on the conventions of the
;; Emacs makefiles; that's no big deal.  What makes them nasty is that
;; they rely on the conventions of separately maintained tools (namely
;; Autoconf for VMS and GNU Autoconf), and the separation of conventions
;; is how people drift apart, dragging their software behind
;; mercilessly.
;;
;; In general, codified thought w/o self-synchronization is doomed.
;; That a generation would eat its young (most discriminatingly, even)
;; is no reason GNU cannot build around such woe.
