* Introduction  -*-grep-*-

This shows the different kinds of messages grep recognizes by default and
how they are rendered.  It is intended both to help you decide which matchers
you need and as a test of the matchers.  Move the mouse over a colored part
to see how much text was actually matched.

Please do not edit this file in grep-mode, it may lose escape
sequences on saving.  Visit this file literally for editing.
