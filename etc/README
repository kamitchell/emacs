This directory contains the architecture-independent files used by or
with Emacs.  This includes some text files of documentation for GNU
Emacs or of interest to Emacs users, and the file of dumped docstrings
for Emacs functions and variables.

Some of the *.tex files need special versions of TeX to typeset them.
The files cs-*.tex and sk-*.tex need csTeX, a special version of TeX
tailored to typesetting Czech and Slovak documents.  We provide
PostScript files for these documents, so that you could print them
without installing the modified TeX versions.

`termcap.src' is included mainly for VMS.  It is a copy of the
`/etc/termcap' file used on Unix.
