This file is about changes in Emacs version 23.

See files NEWS.22, NEWS.21, NEWS.20, NEWS.19, NEWS.18, and NEWS.1-17
for changes in older Emacs versions.

You can narrow news to a specific version by calling `view-emacs-news'
with a prefix argument or by typing C-u C-h C-n.

Temporary note:
 +++ indicates that the appropriate manual has already been updated.
 --- means no change in the manuals is called for.
When you add a new item, please add it without either +++ or ---
so we will look at it and add it to the manual.


* About external Lisp packages


* Installation Changes in Emacs 23.1

** The default X toolkit is now Gtk+, rather than Lucid.

** configure now checks for libgif before libungif when searching for
a GIF library.


* Changes in Emacs 23.1

** If you set find-file-confirm-nonexistent-file to t, then C-x C-f
requires confirmation before opening a non-existent file.

** If the gpm mouse server is running and t-mouse-mode enabled, Emacs uses a
Unix socket in a GNU/Linux console to talk to server, rather than faking events
using the client program mev.  This C level approach provides mouse
highlighting, and help echoing in the minibuffer.

** The new variable next-error-recenter specifies how next-error should
recenter the visited source file.  Its value can be a number (for example,
0 for top line, -1 for bottom line), or nil for no recentering.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 23.1


* Incompatible Editing Changes in Emacs 23.1


* Editing Changes in Emacs 23.1

** New command kill-matching-buffers kills buffers whose name matches a regexp.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 23.1

** css-mode to edit Cascading Style Sheets.

** bibtex-style-mode helps you write BibTeX's *.bst files.

** vera-mode to edit Vera files.

** socks.el (which had been part of W3) is now part of Emacs.

** minibuffer-indicate-depth-mode shows the minibuffer depth in the prompt.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 23.1

** compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error tells `compile' to jump to
the first error encountered during compilations.

** In the `copyright' package, you can specify your copyright holders's names.
Only copyright lines with holders matching copyright-names-regexp will be
considered for update.

** VC
*** VC backends can provide completion of revision names.
*** VC has some support for Bazaar (bzr).

*** VC has some support for Mercurial (hg).

** sgml-electric-tag-pair-mode lets you simultaneously edit matched tag pairs.

** BibTeX mode:

*** New `bibtex-entry-format' options `whitespace', `braces', and
`string', disabled by default.

*** New variable `bibtex-cite-matcher-alist' contains rules to
identify cited keys in BibTeX entries, used by `bibtex-find-crossref.

*** Command `bibtex-url' now allows multiple URLs per entry.

+++
** Tramp

*** New connection methods.
The new methods "plinkx", "plink2", "psftp", "sftp" and "fish" have
been introduced.  There are also new so-called gateway methods
"tunnel" and "socks".

*** Multihop syntax has been removed.
The pseudo-method "multi" has been removed.  Instead of, multi hops
can be specified by the new variable `tramp-default-proxies-alist'.

*** More default settings.
Default values can be set via the variables `tramp-default-user',
`tramp-default-user-alist' and `tramp-default-host'.

*** Connection information is cached.
In order to reduce connection setup, information about used
connections are kept persistent in a file.  The name of this file is
defined in the variable `tramp-persistency-file-name'.

*** Control of remote processes.
Running processes on a remote host can be controlled by settings in
`tramp-remote-path' and `tramp-remote-process-environment'.

*** Success of remote copy is checked.
When the variable `file-precious-flag' is set, the success of a remote
file copy is checked via the file's checksum.

** comint-mode uses `start-file-process' now (see Lisp Changes).
If `default-directory' is a remote file name, subprocesses are started
on the corresponding remote system.


* Changes in Emacs 23.1 on non-free operating systems

---
** IPv6 is supported on MS-Windows.
Emacs now supports IPv6 on Windows XP and later, and earlier versions
of Windows with third party IPv6 stacks installed. Previously IPv6 was
supported on other platforms, but not on Windows due to using the winsock
1.1 header file, even though Emacs was linking to the winsock 2 library.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 23.1

+++
** The function `dired-call-process' has been removed.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 23.1

+++
** In `condition-case', a handler can specify "let the debugger run first".

You do this by writing `debug' in the list of conditions to be handled,
like this:

    (condition-case nil
	(foo bar)
      ((debug error) nil))

** The `require-match' argument to `completing-read' accepts a new value
`confirm-only'.

+++
** The regexp form \(?<num>:<regexp>\) specifies the group number explicitly.

+++
** New variable `user-emacs-directory'.
Use this instead of "~/.emacs.d".

+++
** The new function `image-refresh' refreshes all images associated
with a given image specification.

+++
** The new function `start-file-process is similar to `start-process',
but obeys file handlers.  The file handler is chosen based on
`default-directory'.

+++
** `file-remote-p' has new optional parameters IDENTIFICATION and CONNECTED.
IDENTIFICATION specifies which part of the remote identifier has to be
returned.  With CONNECTED passed non-nil, it is checked whether a
remote connection has been established already.

** The two new functions `looking-at-p' and `string-match-p' can do
the same matching as `looking-at' and `string-match' without changing
the match data.
