* The following icons are a part of Emacs:

mh-logo.xpm: By Satyaki Das for MH-E.

* The default GTK icons were not overridden by the GNOME theme due to
  a bug which was fixed in GNOME 2.15. Once GNOME 2.16 is in wide
  circulation, the GTK icons should be replaced with the equivalent
  GNOME icons.

* Recipe for Creating PBM Versions

1. Edit .xpm image in GIMP.
2. Image > Mode > Indexed. Check Use Black/White Palette and No
   Color Dithering.
3. File > Save As file.xbm.
4. Run xbmtopbm < file.xbm > file.pbm.
