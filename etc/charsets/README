(1) Format of mapping files

Each line contains a code point and the corresponding Unicode
character code separated by a space.  Both code points and Unicode
character codes are in hexadecimal preceded by "0x".  Comments may be
used, starting with "#".  Code ranges may also be used, with
(inclusive) start and end code points separated by "-" followed by the
unicode of the start of the range

Examples:
0xA0 0x00A0  # no-break space

0x8141-0x8143 0x4E04 # map onto a Unicode range


(2) Source of mapping files

All mapping files are generated automatically from data files freely
available on the Internet (e.g. glibc/localedata/charmaps").  See the
file ../../admin/charsets/Makefile for the detail.
