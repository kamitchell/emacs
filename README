This directory tree holds version 22.0.90 of GNU Emacs, the extensible,
customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.

You may encounter bugs in this release.  If you do, please report
them; your bug reports are valuable contributions to the FSF, since
they allow us to notice and fix problems on machines we don't have, or
in code we don't use often.  See the file BUGS for more information on
how to report bugs.

See the file etc/NEWS for information on new features and other
user-visible changes in recent versions of Emacs.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to bring up GNU Emacs on
various systems, once you have loaded the entire subtree of this
directory.

The file etc/PROBLEMS contains information on many common problems that
occur in building, installing and running Emacs.

Reports of bugs in Emacs should be sent to the mailing list
bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org.  See the "Bugs" section of the Emacs
manual for more information on how to report bugs.  (The file `BUGS'
in this directory explains how you can find and read that section
using the Info files that come with Emacs.)  See `etc/MAILINGLISTS'
for more information on mailing lists relating to GNU packages.

The `etc' subdirectory contains several other files, named in capital
letters, which you might consider looking at when installing GNU
Emacs.

The file `configure' is a shell script to acclimate Emacs to the
oddities of your processor and operating system.  It creates the file
`Makefile' (a script for the `make' program), which automates the
process of building and installing Emacs.  See INSTALL for more
detailed information.

The file `configure.in' is the input used by the autoconf program to
construct the `configure' script.  Since Emacs has some configuration
requirements that autoconf can't meet directly, and for historical
reasons, `configure.in' uses an unholy marriage of custom-baked
configuration code and autoconf macros.  If you want to rebuild
`configure' from `configure.in', you will need to install a recent
version of autoconf and GNU m4.

The file `Makefile.in' is a template used by `configure' to create
`Makefile'.

The file `make-dist' is a shell script to build a distribution tar
file from the current Emacs tree, containing only those files
appropriate for distribution.  If you make extensive changes to Emacs,
this script will help you distribute your version to others.

There are several subdirectories:

`src'       holds the C code for Emacs (the Emacs Lisp interpreter and
            its primitives, the redisplay code, and some basic editing
            functions).
`lisp'      holds the Emacs Lisp code for Emacs (most everything else).
`leim'      holds the library of Emacs input methods, Lisp code and
            auxiliary data files required to type international characters
            which can't be directly produced by your keyboard.
`lib-src'   holds the source code for some utility programs for use by or
            with Emacs, like movemail and etags.
`etc'       holds miscellaneous architecture-independent data files
            Emacs uses, like the tutorial text and the Zippy the Pinhead
            quote database.  The contents of the `lisp', `leim', `info',
            `man', `lispref', and `lispintro' subdirectories are
            architecture-independent too.
`info'      holds the Info documentation tree for Emacs.
`man'       holds the source code for the Emacs Manual.  If you modify the
            manual sources, you will need the `makeinfo' program to produce
            an updated manual.  `makeinfo' is part of the GNU Texinfo
            package; you need version 4.2 or later of Texinfo.
`lispref'   holds the source code for the Emacs Lisp reference manual.
`lispintro' holds the source code for the Introduction to Programming
            in Emacs Lisp manual.

`msdos'     holds configuration files for compiling Emacs under MSDOG.
`vms'       holds instructions and useful files for running Emacs under VMS.
`nt'        holds various command files and documentation files that pertain
            to building and running Emacs on Windows 9X/ME/NT/2000/XP.
`mac'       holds instructions, sources, and other useful files for building
            and running Emacs on the Mac.

   Building Emacs on non-Posix platforms requires to install tools
that aren't part of the standard distribution of the OS.  The
platform-specific README files and installation instructions should
list the required tools.

VMS info:

Emacs 19.x and above do not compile out of the box on OpenVMS.
Richard Levitte <levitte@lp.se> is distributing and maintaining a
version of Emacs (currently based on version 19.28, but soon moving to
19.34 and then 20.1) that compiles and works on OpenVMS 5.5 and above
on both VAX and Alpha architectures.  For more information see

  http://www.lp.se/gnu-vms/software/released1/emacs.html

There is also some effort going on with Emacs 21.  Source code is
available at ftp://ftp.nvg.ntnu.no/pub/vms/emacs/.  Look for most
recent stuff with ls -lta.

It is a working "development" version (editing and much more works).
More developers are needed; contact roart@nvg.ntnu.no.
