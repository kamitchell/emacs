The source and copyright status of dictionary files in this directory
are categorised into these three.

(1) cangjie-table.b5
    cangjie-table.cns

These are verbatim copies of what distributed by the author Christian
Wittern himself.  Each file contains a copyright notice.

(2) CTLau.html
    CTLau-b5.html

These are verbatim copies of what distributed at the authors home page
<umunhum.stanford.edu/~lee/chicomp/> Each file contains a copyright
notice.

(3) pinyin.map
    ziranma.cin

These are verbatim copies of what distributed with a free packaged
called CCE at:
	http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main
		/source/utils/cce_0.36.orig.tar.gz

As those files themselves don't contain copyright notices, the
copyright notice of the package itself should cover them.
